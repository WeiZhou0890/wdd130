            <h2>Cayenne advantages</h2>
            <p>You don't expect a large SUV to feel so quick. But when it wears a Porsche badge, it's expected. Even the base Cayenne unspools steady streams of power from any double-digit speed. We tested the Cayenne with the V6, and 0-60 mph takes just 5.3 seconds, which is impressive for a big SUV that tips the scales at 4,700 pounds. The transmission is well calibrated, but the brake pedal stroke is a little longer than expected for a Porsche.

                Handling is superb. Our tester — with 21-inch wheels, PASM (Porsche Active Suspension Management) and the Sport Chrono package — produces seemingly endless amounts of grip in curves. The steering is a little heavier than an SUV requires but certainly plays into the Cayenne's sporting pretensions.</p>

            <h2>Cayenne interior</h2>
            <p>A broad range of driving positions and roomy quarters allow the Cayenne to feel either like a proper sports car — such as a 911 — or a more conventional SUV. Though it has the same number of seats as the smaller Macan, the increased wheelbase provides plenty of room for all passengers. It's easy to slide in and out of.

                The cockpit controls have a quality feel to them, with knurled dials and rocker switches. Unfortunately, some are placed awkwardly and tightly in front of the gear selector, but these are redundant since most are found on the steering wheel.</p>
